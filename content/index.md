## Topic Modeling Background
- Why topic modeling still matters
- Statistical foundations
- Limits of topic modeling


### Applications
- Social media
- Business operations

### Popular APIs
- BERTopic
- FASTopic

### Evaluation & Optimization


### Hierarchical Topic Trends & Visualizing Relationships
- How topics evolve across time (e.g., seasonal complaints, feature shifts).
- Identifying parent/child topic hierarchies.
- Statistical significance tests on topic prevalence across groups (A/B, region, demographics).


## LLM Topic Enrichment
- Summarization
- Automated Labeling
- Contextual enrichment


##  Unstructured Information -> Signal -> Action
- Applying statistical testing to validate observed trends.
- Turning noisy text into actionable KPIs (e.g., which customer segment mentions durability most).
Detecting weak signals or emerging trends.
